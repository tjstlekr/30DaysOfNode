In this chapter of 30 days of node tutorial series, we learned about how we can use crypto module in node.js
for hash and HMAC operations. We learned about the snippets of SHA512 , ripemd160 , SHA256 , SHA384 , SHA224 , SHA1 ,
 md5 , whirlpool cryptographic hashing algorithms. Also, we learned about hashing a file using node.js crypto module.
